## Files

### 01_intro_to_pandas.ipynb
* Gives an introduction to pandas, Series and DataFrame data structures
* Imports CSV data to a pandas DataFrame and runs operations

### 02_hello_world.ipynb
* HelloWorld TensorFlow program

### 03_tensorflow_programming_concepts.ipynb
* Tensors, Operations, Graphs and Sessions
* Building a TensorFlow graph

### 04_mandelbrot_set.ipynb
* Visualize the mandelbrot set using TensorFlow

### 05_creating_and_manipulating_tensors.ipynb
* Creating and manipulating tensors
* Refreshing memory about addition and multiplication in linear algebra
* TensorFlow math and array operations

### 06_first_steps_with_tensor_flow.ipynb
* Use the LinearRegressor class in TensorFlow to predict median housing price
* Evaluate accuracy of a model's predictions using Root Mean Squared Error (RSME) and tune hyperparameters

### 07_synthetic_features_and_outliers.ipynb
* Create synthetic features by taking the ratio of two other features
* Use this new feature as an input to a linear regression model and remove outliars

### 08_validation.ipynb
* Use multiple features instead of a single feature to improve model effectivenes
* Use test data to check if a model is overfitting the data

### 09_feature_sets.ipynb
* Create a minimal set of features that performs just as well as a more complex feature set

### 10_logistic_regression.ipynb
* Reframe models from previous exercises as a binary classification model
* Compare model effectiveness between linear and logistic regression

### 11_sparsity_and_l1_regularization.ipynb
* Calculate the size of a model
* Apply L1 regularization to reduce the size of a model by increasing sparsity

### 12_feature_crosses.ipynb
* Improve a linear regression model  with the addition of synthetic features
* Introduce one-hot encoding, binning and feature crosses

### 13_improving_neural_net_performance.ipynb
* Improve performance of a neural network by normalizing features and applying various optimization algorithms

### 14_intro_to_sparse_data_and_embeddings.ipynb
* Convert movie review strings to a sparse feature vector
* Implement a sentiment analysis linear model and upgrade it to a DNN model using an embedded vector projecting the data into two dimensions
* Visualize the embedding to see what the model learned about the relationships

### 15_intro_to_fairness.ipynb
* Learn about different types of biases
* Identify different sources of bias before training
* Evaluate model performance by sub-group rather than in aggregate
